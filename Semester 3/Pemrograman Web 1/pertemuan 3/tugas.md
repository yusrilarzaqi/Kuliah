# Perfect

## Ed Sheeran

<p>I found a love, for me</p>
<p>Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead</p>
<p>Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet</p>
<p>Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</p>

<br />

<p>'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love</p>
<p>Not knowing what it was</p>
<p>I will not give you up this time</p>
<p>But darling, just kiss me slow</p>
<p>Your heart is all I own</p>
<p>And in your eyes, you're holding mine</p>

<br />

  <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark</p>
  <p>With you between my arms</p>
  <p>Barefoot on the grass</p>
  <p>Listening to our favourite song</p>
  <p>When you said you looked a mess</p>
  <p>I whispered underneath my breath</p>
  <p>But you heard it</p>
  <p>Darling, you look perfect tonight</p>

<br />

<p>Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know</p>
<p>She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home</p>
<p>I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets</p>
<p>To carry love, to carry children of our own</p>

<br />

<p>We are still kids, but we're so in love</p>
<p>Fighting against all odds</p>
<p>I know we'll be alright this time</p>
<p>Darling, just hold my hand</p>
<p>Be my girl, I'll be your man</p>
<p>I see my future in your eyes</p>

  <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark</p>
  <p>With you between my arms</p>
  <p>Barefoot on the grass</p>
  <p>Listening to our favorite song</p>
  <p>When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful</p>
  <p>I don't deserve this</p>
  <p>Darling, you look perfect tonight</p>

<br />

<p>(No, no, no)</p>

  <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark</p>
  <p>With you between my arms</p>
  <p>Barefoot on the grass</p>
  <p>Listening to our favorite song</p>
  <p>I have faith in what I see</p>
  <p>Now I know I have met an angel in person</p>
  <p>And she looks perfect</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>I don't deserve this</p>
  <p>You look perfect tonight</p>

## Julia's daily routine

Hello. I am Julia. I get up early, at 7. I get dressed in the bedroom - my favourite green sweater. I have breakfast in the kitchen, I like orange juice and a sandwich for breakfast. I brush my teeth in the bathroom. My teeth are white! I go to school at 8. At school I have lunch - rice and tomatoes and some chicken or fish. After school I go to the park and play with my friends - Kate and Mary. I have dinner at 7. I eat salad. I go to bed at 8.

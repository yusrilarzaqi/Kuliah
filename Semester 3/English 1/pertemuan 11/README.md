# Degree of Comparasion

**_Degree of Comparasion_** is a kind of a comparasion used to compare somthing with another thing or with the others using adjective to compare.

There are three ways you can compare adjectives.

- Positive.
- Comparative.
- Superlative.

## Positive with as

The positive from is used in cases where there are no differences between the two compared things or persons.
To form the positive, we use the world as before and after the absolute form of the adjective.

- Martin is **as tall as** John.
- She is **as beautiful as** her sister.

This can also be applied in a negative context to indicate that the compared object are not similar :

- Martin is **not as tall as** Jhon.
- She is **not as beautiful as** her sister.

## Comparasion - the basic rules

When two objects or persons are being compared, the comparitive form of the ajective is used.
The comparative adjective can be formed in two ways:

- **_Adding -er to the absolute form of the adjective._**
- tall -> taller -> (the) tallest
- **Adding the word more before the adjective.**
- beautiful -> more beautiful -> cleaner -> (the) most beautiful.

Which one to use depends on the number of syllabels in the adjective.

## Noun

A noun is a word that names something, such as a person, place, thing, or idea.
In a sentence, nouns can play the role of suject, direct object, subject complement, object complement, appositive, or adjective.

**The way of recognizing a noun is by its:**

- ending.
- position.
- function.

### Noun ending

There are certain world endings that show that a word is noun, for example:

- ity - nationality.
- ment -> applointment.
- ness -> happiness.
- ation -> relation.
- hood -> childhood.

But this is not true of the word endings of all nouns.
For example, the noun "snpoonful" ends in _ful_, but thhe adjective "careful" also ends in _ful_.

### Noun position

We can often recognize a noun by its position in the ssentence.
Nouns often come after a determiner (a determiner is a word like a, an, the, this, my, such):

- a relief.
- an afternoon.
- the doctor.

Nouns often come after oone or more adjectives:

- a great relief.
- a peaceful afternoon.

### Function in a sentence

Nouns have certain functions (jobs) in a sentence, for example:

- subject of verb : Doctor work hard.
- object of verb : He likes coffee.
- subject and object of verb : Teachers teach students.

But the subject or object of sentence is not always a noun.
It could be a pronoun or a phrase.
In the sentence "My doctor works hard", the noun is "doctor" but the subject is "My doctor".

## Pronoun

Pronouns are the words you substitute for specific nouns when the reader or listener knows which specific noun you're referring to.

You might say "Jennifer was supposed to be here at eight," then follow it with "she's always late; next time I'll tell her to be here a half-hour earlier".

Instead of saying Jennifer's name three times in a row, you substituted she and her and your sentences remained grammatically correct. Pronouns are divided into a range of categories, and we cover them all in our guide to pronouns:

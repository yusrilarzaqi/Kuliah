          Ubuntu is a complete desktop Linux operating system, freely available with both community and professional
          <br>
          support. The Ubuntu community is built on the ideas enshrined in the Ubuntu Manifesto: that software should be
          <br>
          available free of charge, that software tools should be usable by people in their local language and despite
          <br>
          any disabilities, and that people should have the freedom to customise and alter their software in whatever
          <br>
          way they see fit. "Ubuntu" is an ancient African word, meaning "humanity to others". The Ubuntu distribution
          <br>
          brings the spirit of Ubuntu to the software world. <br>

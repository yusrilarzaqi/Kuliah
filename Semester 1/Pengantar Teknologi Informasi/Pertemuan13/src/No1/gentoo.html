        <p>Gentoo Linux is a versatile and fast, completely free Linux distribution geared towards developers and <br>
          network professionals. Unlike other distros, Gentoo Linux has an advanced package management system called
          <br>
          Portage. Portage is a true ports system in the tradition of BSD ports, but is Python-based and sports a
          number<br>

          of advanced features including dependencies, fine-grained package management, "fake" (OpenBSD-style) installs,
          <br>
          safe unmerging, system profiles, virtual packages, config file management, and more. <br>
